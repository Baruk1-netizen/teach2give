### Challenge 2: Frontend Development Challenge - Simple FAQ Accordion

#### Objective:
Create a basic FAQ accordion using only HTML and CSS.

#### Task Description:
1. **What Youâ€™re Building:**
   - An FAQ component where users can click a question to show or hide its answer.

2. **Core Functionality:**
   - When a user clicks on a question, its answer should become visible.
   - If another question is clicked, the previous answer should hide, ensuring an accordion behavior.

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - On mobile, the questions and answers should stack vertically.
   - On larger screens (like tablets or desktops), the layout should display in a way that fits larger screen sizes.

#### Requirements:
- **HTML & CSS Only**: The solution should be developed using basic HTML and CSS without JavaScript.
- **Accordion Behavior**: Ensure that clicking one question hides the previously displayed answer and shows the new one.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: The design should adapt to smaller screens with vertical stacking of FAQ items.
