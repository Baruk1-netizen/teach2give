# FAQ Accordion: Frontend Development Challenge

## Objective
Build a simple and responsive FAQ accordion using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## Description
This project involves creating a functional FAQ component that allows users to interact with a list of questions and their corresponding answers. The accordion behavior ensures a clean and user-friendly interface.

---

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Show/Hide Answers:**
  - Clicking on a question reveals its answer.
  - Clicking on another question hides the previously open answer (accordion behavior).
  - JavaScript handles the toggling of the plus and minus icons for better user interaction.

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile Layout:**
  - Questions and answers stack vertically for ease of navigation.
- **Tablet/Desktop Layout:**
  - A more spacious layout for better readability, with questions and answers aligned as appropriate.

  - Animate the showing and hiding of answers for a smooth user experience.
  - Ensure proper alignment and spacing for both mobile and larger screens.

- Implement responsive design using:
  - CSS media queries.
  - Flexbox or CSS Grid for layout.

### JavaScript
- Use JavaScript to:
  - Handle click events for toggling the visibility of answers.
  - Dynamically update the plus and minus icons based on the question's state (expanded or collapsed).
